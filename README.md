# Description

This project was created to generate a fast, efficient and professional Team Profile straight from the command line. Using the inquirer module from node.js, we prompt user for data on employees on their team. Once finished you will have a custom html page with 'cards' for each employee. This project also uses the Jest module for testing each object or TDD, found in the tests folder.
